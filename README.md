* [x]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [x] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [x] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
* [x] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [x] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right

* [ ] User can view following / followers list through any profile they view.
* [ ] Use the View Binding library to reduce view boilerplate.
